Several shocks that range from the disruption in the global production chain to increasing commodity prices due to the Ukraine war have increased CPI inflation to levels incompatible with central banks’ mandate of price stability.

Instead, when negative supply shocks - like an oil shock - hit the economy central bankers face a nasty trade-off between price stability and unemployment, at least in the short run. Bringing inflation down to hit the target in the short run is technically possible but, is it worth the economic downturn and the increase in unemployment that this would entail? Most central banks consider that it is not since they take the inflation target as a medium run goal. Within this time frame central banks face two uncertainties that condition their decision. \n",

    "1. Consider the following words taken from a 2022 speech by Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm): <i>\"Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.(…) During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decision making of households and businesses. The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions. (…) History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the text, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. What do you think Mr. Powell means with <i>\"softening of labor market conditions\"</i>?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Which of the two active policy scenarios (\"CB that slowly accepts change to unemployment\" and \"CB that accepts costly recession and unemployment below equilibrium to prioritise inflation\") better fits the 1970’s experience described by Powell? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Which of the two active policy scenarios better fits Jerome Powell’s intentions in 2022? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Consider scenario number 3 where the central bank quickly reacts to the shock. You can see that in this scenario the interest rate and the unemployment rate peak to 5,5% and 9%, respectively. Now consider scenario number 2 and let us imagine that in period 15 the central bank resolves to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation back to the target. How tight should monetary policy be compared to scenario 3 (more/less)? How much unemployment would it cause compared to scenario 3 (more/less)? Why? Which part of the text can help you to answer these questions?\n"

    "With higher anchoring, inflation expectations are less affected by the temporary upsurge in inflation. Therefore, the central bank needs to increase the interest rate to a lesser extent to achieve their aim of calming inflation. This results in both a lower short run increase in unemployment and a faster return of inflation to its pre-shock level. In the extreme case when there is full anchoring, the central bank just needs to adjust the interest rate to its new equilibrium level from the very onset in order to drive inflation back to its pre-shock level.\n"
